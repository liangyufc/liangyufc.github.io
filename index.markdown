I'm a master students majoring in Computer Science at Natinoal Chiao Tung University in Taiwan. My research interests are biomedical informatics and biomedical engineering. 
I graduated from [National Tsing Hua University](http://www.nthu.edu.tw/) in 2018.
In the summer of 2017, I was a development intern at [Onysus](http://www.onysus.com/), a computer vision startup in Israel.
I cofounded VinoAI with my friends in 2018. We aimed to provide cryptocurrency investors with insights by using machine learning. We were promoted as one of the ten representatives by the Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan and were trained at [Plug and Play Tech Center](https://www.plugandplaytechcenter.com/) in the U.S. 
In the summer of 2019, I interned at a prominent company, [aetherAI](https://aetherai.com/), in developing AI for medical image analysis.
I have recently received BioPro A+ scholarship from the Ministry of Education to do research in KU Leuven next semester.
